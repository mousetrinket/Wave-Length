# Wave Length
Discord bot that takes a word from two or more players and compares whether or not they are the same word. The goal is for all players to guess a word based off the previous words said until everyone says the same word. 

The bot is themed from the perspective of an autonomous non-organic entity.

Wave Length will be hosted online soon.

Thank you to [Roachbones](https://github.com/Roachbones) for the idea.
